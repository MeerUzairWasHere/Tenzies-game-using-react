# Tenzies-game-using-react


TENZIE is a fun and addictive dice game that challenges your luck and strategic thinking. This Git repository contains my implementation of TENZIE, which I developed following a course on Scrimba.

In addition to the features covered in the course, I have added three new features to the game:

Roll counter: The game now keeps track of each dice roll, so you can see how many rolls it takes you to get to the target number.

Previous best score: The game remembers your previous best score, so you can try to beat your own record.

Saving score to local storage: The game saves your current score to local storage, so you can pick up where you left off even if you close the browser or refresh the page.

I hope you enjoy playing TENZIE as much as I enjoyed building it!
